Q: Does Cloudscraper OSSE keep all files and emails in the database?
A: No, for performance and space reasons. However if you want to do so,
you can edit your existing location and check "available offline" option.
Keep in mind that if you have a lot of files/emails/resources, this can
significantly slow down crawling!
